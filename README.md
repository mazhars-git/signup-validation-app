# Getting Started with Create React App

## I have used Material UI for UI design and also used React Bootstrap.

## To Run the App open VS Code and run: npm start in the terminal


NB: I could not complete the requirements of the tsk. I have done just frontend design and tried to fulfill other requirements, but unfortunately could not complete.

I decided that I won't submit the task , but for just your review.... Next time I will try in my label best. Thanks in advance for your feedback.
